# Performing Gender Through Dialogue

###

This repository contains code for embeddings, analysis, plots and results of our article: 

Lucas van der Deijl & Alie Lassche, "Performing Gender Through Dialogue. A Computational Approach to Male and Female Speech in Dutch Drama (1600-1800)" in _Early Modern Low Countries_ (forthcoming).

## Useful directions 📌

Some useful directions:
- `emlc-performing-gender/` the main folder contains the Python files to get the results
- `/figs/` contains the figures generated by the notebooks
- `/notebooks/` contains the notebooks used for the analysis
- `/results/` contains results of the experiments


## Data & article 📝
